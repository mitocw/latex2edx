This is an edXmath example.

\begin{edXmath}
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\rho) &=&  -\lambda_{1} \log \lambda_{1} -\lambda_{2} \log \lambda_{2} \\
        &=&  H((1+r)/2)
\end{eqnarray}
\end{edXmath}

This is text after the edXmath.

Contrast that with

\begin{eqnarray}
S(\rho) &=&  -\lambda_{1} \log \lambda_{1} -\lambda_{2} \log \lambda_{2} \\
        &=&  H((1+r)/2)
\end{eqnarray}

which plastex mangles into a table, that still does render ok.
